# SpacePotatoesGame

## Inspiration
When creating this project, I was inspired by mobile space games, as well as the theme of Space Potatoes. I decided to make the user control a spaceship, and try to avoid the flying potatoes!

## What it does
This is a game controlled by the up and down arrow keys. When the player hits one of the potatoes, the game ends.

## How we built it
I built this using Python and the library Arcade (to handle animation), using the online IDE platform repl.it. I created the graphics using pixil.art.

## Challenges we ran into
I had some challenges making the potatoes appear at random intervals, and also making the game over message at the end.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I'm proud of myself for participating and making a fully working game for my first hackathon. I learned how to use the Arcade library, and made my first animated Python game.

## What we learned
I learned how to use Arcade, and how to generate potatoes at random locations by random.randint for the x position of a new potato. 

## What's next for Space Potatoes Game
I can show my game to my family and friends.
